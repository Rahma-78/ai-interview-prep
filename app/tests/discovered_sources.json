Candidates should understand Python's key features, such as its simple and readable syntax, extensive libraries, and cross-platform compatibility. Crucial data types include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Candidates should explain their distinct characteristics, use cases, and performance implications, particularly the difference between mutable and immutable types. Questions on list, dictionary, and tuple comprehensions are also valuable.
